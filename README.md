Mini Challenge #9 - Restaurant Picker
This program asks the user for a restaurant category and then prints out a random restaurant from a preselected array of 10

Peer review by: Freddy Aguilar
The project allowed me to tate whether I was hungry or not, since I am using a restaurant picker program. I liked how if I entered no, t tells me why am I here then. When I entered yes, the program then asked if I would like one of three options of food types. When I choose one it pulls from an array of ten for the selected category and offers the choice as a possible restaurant to check out. Everyting works as intended and I enjoyed playing through it. Good job!
